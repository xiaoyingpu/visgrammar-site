title: "SIG on Visualization Grammars at CHI '21"
---


A Special Interest Group at [ACM CHI 2021](http://chi2021.acm.org/). Tue, May 11 13:00 - 15:00 EDT. [Link to Program](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2021/program/session/57295).

## Introduction

Visualization grammars, often based on the _Grammar of Graphics_, are popular choices for specifying expressive visualizations and supporting visualization systems. However, there are still open questions about grammar design and evaluation not well-answered
in visualization research. 

In this SIG, we will discuss what makes a grammar “good” and explore evaluation methodologies best suited for visualization grammars.


## Tentative Format

Panel and breakout discussions.
