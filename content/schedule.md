## Agenda 


- 10 min: [Xiaoying] a quick intro to the SIG (schedule) and visualization grammars.

  - Dominik Moritz: Vega-Lite or Draco (including Draco2)
  - Leland Wilkinson: Grammar of Graphics
  - Hadley Wickham: ggplot2
  - Xiaoying Pu: Challenges in evaluating visualization grammars encountered in the Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics project
- 20 min: continue panel discussion, and invite participants to introduce themselves and ask questions, providing their research background and specific interests in visualization grammars. Organizers summarize themes and form discussion points for the breakout groups.
- 35 min: breakout group discussion. We will try to have one organizer for each group.
- 20 min: groups report back on their discussions. Organizers then summarize the progress and make plans for future research contacts.


### Potential topics to discuss

- Lessons from developing grammars
- Whatâ€™s wrong with the current evaluation of grammars and how can we improve it?
- What is a visualization grammar?
